# KikNameChecker

!THIS ONLY CHECKS WS2.KIK.COM ENDPOINT!
\ Will add user inputted endpoints thing \

A (probably) working Kik name checker

Started as a supposedly simple project,
ended up taking multiple hours because I may have autism.

Don't know how Kik works but it takes a name from usernames.txt and goes to ws2.kik.com/user/{username}, if it returns a 404, it is a valid user.
